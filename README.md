detection of thyroid disease using xray images

Although the thyroid is often known as a disease, it is actually an organ located in front of the trachea, under the area of 
the throat known as the Adam's apple. The thyroid, which resembles the letter U or H and has a butterfly-like shape,
is responsible for the production of hormones that regulate many functions in the body.

T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) hormones as well as calcitonin hormone production, storage and release when necessary,
the thyroid is approximately the size of a walnut and its total weight is 15 to 20 g. as much. The middle part of the thyroid, which has a length of four cm,
a width of one to two cm, and consists of the right and left lobes, is defined as the isthmus in the medical language.



The thyroid is a gland. You have glands throughout your body, where they create and release substances that help your body do a specific thing.
Your thyroid makes hormones that help control many vital functions of your body.

When your thyroid doesn’t work properly, it can impact your entire body. If your body makes too much thyroid hormone,
you can develop a condition called hyperthyroidism.
If your body makes too little thyroid hormone, it’s called hypothyroidism. Both conditions are serious and need to be treated by your healthcare provider.
